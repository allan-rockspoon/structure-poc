// developers tried with the lifecycle callbacks, all failed to produce one bug free extension,
// which explain why such extension was not promptly created by the Android Team. It's not as
// trivial as it looks and some weird bugs happens when you try to, for example, change device's
// orientation. For now we will have to stick with inheritance or manually do it.
